Currently possible:
1. resolve raspberry connection issue
-connect to raspberry
-establish wireless communucation without 42 Wifi (maybe through server)
2.  Draw electrical schematic
-with Santosh Later
3.  Get radio signal transmitter/receiver to avoid connection via SSH
-find and buy receiver and transmitter
4. Implement ISP/I2C connection between Raspberry Pi and Arduino to transfer bidirectional data and signals
-needs raspberry access

Soon possible:
1. Fix motor mount CAD and print new model
2. Test code, especially the main motor
-Testing main motor, for that CAD for motormount needs tbd

Parallel:
1. Design first simple PCB with Arduino and Raspberry Pi still connected
-part time work, not restricted through other points
